cpi 00H			; before Adding again and again we are checking that is the data present in accumulator is zero.
; If data in the accumulator is zero then no need to perform any operation.bcz 0 * any number = 0
jz STR			; if comparison of 00h any A register is zero then go to STR label
LOOP:	dad D		; if A hold non zero data then add HL + DE pair and store result to HL register
	dcr A		; Decreament A register
	jnz LOOP	; if A is not zero then go to line 10 again and perform operation
STR:	SHLD 0005H	; Store the result back to memory location
